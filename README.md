# Agricultural Knowledge Concordance — OEDP-inspired GitHub Pages Site

This is a fresh static site that preserves the core **layout + function** of the OEDP-style experience:
- minimal sticky header
- over-left slide drawer menu
- editorial hero with a left feature area and right tile grid
- section cards, split panels, events list, and footer

## Publish on GitHub Pages
1. Create a GitHub repository.
2. Upload everything in this folder to the repository root.
3. GitHub → Settings → Pages → Deploy from branch → `main` → `/ (root)`.
