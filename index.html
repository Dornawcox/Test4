          <details>
            <summary>What is a Concordance Fellow?</summary>
            <p>A Fellow is a trusted contributor helping build the first-year foundation of the Concordance—especially the map, directory, tool library, and the stewardship practices that make shared agricultural knowledge durable, attributable, and safe to reuse.</p>
          </details>

          <details>
            <summary>When does the call for nominations open?</summary>
            <p>The call for nominations (including self-nominations) will be announced at the Feb 13 Concordance virtual sessions.</p>
          </details>

          <details>
            <summary>Who can be nominated? Can I self-nominate?</summary>
            <p>We welcome nominations of land stewards, Indigenous knowledge holders, community leaders, data stewards, librarians/archivists, tool builders, civic technologists, organizers, and researchers. Self-nominations are encouraged.</p>
          </details>

          <details>
            <summary>What is the time commitment?</summary>
            <p>Fellows meet once per month as a cohort. Fellows are invited (not required) to share short updates or present their work to the wider community. The program is designed to be lightweight and flexible.</p>
          </details>

          <details>
            <summary>What support do Fellows receive?</summary>
            <p>Fellows receive a monthly cohort space, public recognition, a stipend (issued as a contract), and opportunities to shape Concordance priorities during the first year.</p>
          </details>

          <details>
            <summary>What about data sovereignty, sensitive knowledge, or safety concerns?</summary>
            <p>We do not ask Fellows to publish sensitive information. Fellows can work at an appropriate sharing level (public, community-only, or restricted) and will be supported in consent-forward practices and selective disclosure.</p>

            A concordance is more than a list. It’s an index that preserves provenance and context, and points to where copies live—so knowledge remains usable over time.

              Durable knowledge has a clear lineage, stewards who can maintain it, and terms that prevent misuse.
              It can be found again, understood in context, and updated without losing trust.

            <p>
              This starter site is intentionally simple. As entries accumulate, we’ll add searchable pages, filters, hosted circles,
              Fellows profiles, and templates for data trusts and shared governance.
